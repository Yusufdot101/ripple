## 🌊 What is Ripple?

Ripple is a real-time chat application where messages flow instantly — no refresh, no delay. Create rooms, invite people, and just talk. Built as a deep dive into WebSockets, event-driven architecture, and full-stack development.

> Think Discord, but stripped down to what actually matters.
